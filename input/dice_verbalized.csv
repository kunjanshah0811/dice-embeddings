Kunal is a  Masters Student (Computer Science) at University of Bonn and works as a Research Assistant at AKSW in Leipzig. Before joining AKSW, Kunal has completed Bachelors in Information and Communication Technology from DA-IICT, India.

Kunal's  recent works have been in the areas of Benchmarking and  Semantic Search systems but in due course of his activities he has developed interests in Software-Container Virtualisation (Docker), Machine Learning, Knowledge Graphs, NLP and Functional Programming Approaches.

He completed his Bachelor's Thesis with AKSW in May 2016 on a tool that helps in improving NER/ NED gold standard Datasets. He also  completed his [Google Summer of Code 2016](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2016/projects/6452757254897664/) with DBpedia and is currently a co-maintainer for the [DBpedia Lookup Service](https://github.com/dbpedia/lookup#maintainers).

## Biography

Daniel Leite is a researcher in the Department of Computer Science, Data Science (DICE) Group, Paderborn University, Germany. For 11 years he was a professor and researcher at the UFLA and UFMG, Brazil; and UAI, Chile, in the areas of dynamic systems, fuzzy systems, neural networks, data mining, and control theory. He earned his PhD from the State University of Campinas, UNICAMP, Brazil, 2012, and was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia, 2018-2019, and Federal University of Minas Gerais, UFMG, Brazil, 2013-2014.

https://dice-research.org/DiegoMoussallem https://schema.dice-research.org/content  My overall background is on CS, but the majority of my career I have spent on NLP. Thus, I have worked on different NLP tasks ranging from basic research in computational linguistics to Entity Linking, Machine Translation, Natural Language Generation, and Question Answering. My work resulted in the first neural machine translation model augmented with knowledge graphs and one state-of-the-art framework in respect of multilingualism and knowledge-graph-based algorithms. Additionally, I contribute actively to the scientific community, being responsible for the Portuguese chapter of DBpedia as well as mentoring students at the Google Summer of Code. I am currently a senior NLP research scientist, leading the NLP team, in the DICE research group at Paderborn University. Previously, I was a researcher at AKSW (Leipzig, DE), working on Information Retrieval and NLP. I hold an MSc. and a Ph.D.
